# Scanner.py â€” Automated Enumeration Toolkit

very nice readme - definitely WIP

this is a poc for what I was thinking. It will make a bunch of folders and files and stuff based on the engagement name. Then you can run modules or specific tools and it will run for all targets.


```bash
python scanner.py

> enumerate
# ...
> nikto default
```
